# Youverify Task Challenge
This is some  Javascript tasks to implement some Data Structures and Algorithms.

# Procedure
- **Is Unique**: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

- **Check Permutation**: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

- **URLify**: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with "%20". You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are
given the "true" length of te string. (Note: if implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.) EXAMPLE Input: "Mr John Smith",
13 output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

- **Palindrome Permutation**: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A
permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (prmutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)

- **One Away**: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a fucntion to check
if they are one edit(or zero edits) away.
EXAMPLE
pale, ple -> true
pales, pale -> true
pale, bale -> true
pale, bake -> false

- **String Compression**: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabvvvvvaa would become a2b1c5a3. if the "compressed"
string would not become smaller than the orignal string, your method should return the original string. You can assme the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).
 
 # How To Run
 This was done using **Vitejs Application** to execute things up faster.
